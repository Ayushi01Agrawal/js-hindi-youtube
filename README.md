### Variable scope
-- Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
-- Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.
-- Function scope: The scope created with a function.
-- In addition, variables declared with let or const can belong to an additional scope:

-- Block scope: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block).
-- When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a ---- variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

-- let and const declarations can also be scoped to the block statement that they are declared in.
